Generation of source code for the calculation of molecular integrals using 
recurrence relations. Written in Python 3.x. 

If you use Intception in your research, please cite J. C. Womack's PhD thesis:

  Chemistry", Ph. D., University of Bristol, Bristol, 2015

Chapter 4 of this thesis describes the original design and implementation of 
Intception, and can be accessed online at the following URL:

          Clarification of status of generated code and input scripts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GNU General Public License version 3 (see the LICENSE file, or 
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>) states:

"The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if 
the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work." 
                                                     (2. Basic Permissions)

We (the authors of this work) do NOT consider the source code generated by 
Intception to be a covered work, as defined in the license. You may therefore 
distribute code generated by Intception under terms of your choice.

This does not constitute an exception or additional permission to the existing
license, but is intended to clarify the status of the output of Intception for
users. 

We encourage you to make use of code generated by Intception in your own 
software, regardless of the nature of the license used on that software. 
Note that we (the authors) accept no liability and provide no warranty for
the software, or the output of the software (see sections 15 and 16 of 
the GNU General Public License version 3).

Note for developers: If you modify Intception such that the source code 
generated does constitute a covered work, under the definitions laid out in the
license, please remove the above clarification to avoid confusion.

In addition, we (the authors of this work) do NOT consider user-created scripts 
which import components of Intception SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENERATING 
SOURCE CODE using Intception to be part of the covered work. We refer to these 
as "input scripts" and encourage you to create and share your own input scripts 
under terms of your own choice.

However, we DO consider any substantial larger work which incorporates 
Intception, or imports parts of Intception, to be a "modified version" of the 
software, as distinct from an input script, and thus subject to the terms 
relating to conveying modified source versions (section 5 of the license).
